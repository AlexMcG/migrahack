                              <p>This app was built over the course of two days during the <a href="http://www.chicagomigrahack.com/">Chicago MigraHack Hackathon</a> that took place May 31 - June 2, 2013 in Chicago, Illinois at the incubator and coworking space, Cibola. The data used in this app was obtained from www.data.gov and can be found in its raw form <a href="https://explore.data.gov/Other/Persons-Obtaining-Legal-Permanent-Resident-Status-/6xns-6yj4">here</a>.</p>
                              <p>It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It utilizes the <a href="http://www.littlesparkvt.com/flatstrap/">Flatstrap</a> CSS framework, <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>, and the <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a> JavaScript library; all data is being pulled into the app using a custom written parser also written in JavaScript.</p>
